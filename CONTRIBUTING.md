   npm install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Compile the extension**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   # or
   pnpm run compile
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the coding standards below
   - Test your changes thoroughly
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Run tests and linting**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   # or
   pnpm run lint
   ```

4. **Test the extension**
   - Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the extension development host
   - Test your changes in the new VS Code window

5. **Submit a pull request**
   - Provide a clear description of your changes
   - Include any relevant issue numbers
   - Add screenshots if UI changes are involved

## üìù Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add proper type annotations
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Follow the existing code formatting
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

### Git Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:
- `feat: add support for new comment tags`
- `fix: resolve issue with multiline comments`
- `docs: update README with new features`
- `refactor: improve comment parsing logic`

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

Test your changes with:

1. **Different file types** - Test with various language files
2. **Different comment styles** - Single-line, multiline, JSDoc
3. **Edge cases** - Empty comments, special characters
4. **Performance** - Large files, many comments

### Test Files

Create test files in different languages to verify functionality:

```hcl
# OpenTofu/Terraform EXAMPLE
/**
 * * Important information about this infrastructure
 * ! This configuration is deprecated, do not use in new deployments
 * ? Should we refactor this for better performance?
 * TODO: Add comprehensive validation rules
 * //TODO: Mark this task as complete.
 * FIXME: The resource naming convention needs standardization
 * HACK: Temporary workaround for provider version issue
 * BUG: This module has known issues with nested loops
 * UNDONE: Remove debug outputs before production
 */

variable "project_name" {
  description = "The name of the project"
  type        = string
  default     = "my-project"
  
  #? Should we add validation for project name format?
  #TODO: Add regex validation
}

locals {
  #* Common tags applied to all resources
  common_tags = {
    Project     = var.project_name
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
    #UNDONE: Add cost center tag after approval
  }
  
  #BUG: This calculation might overflow for large numbers
  resource_count = length(var.resource_list) * 2
  
  #FIXME: This naming convention needs review
  resource_name = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}"
}

output "project_name" {
  description = "The name of the project"
  value       = var.project_name
  
  #* This output is used by other modules
}

#//// aws_instance.example -- commentedOut;
```
